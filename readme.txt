== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this Venmo plugin integrate with the payment APIs? =

This plugin is a quick and easy way to display to your customers your Venmo username and to link them to it.
Unfortunately, this plugin doesn't integrate a full Venmo end-to-end payment. It only displays your Venmo username to the customer and redirects them to it so that the off site Venmo transaction can take place.

Please check screenshots for more details on what is reported.
