## Frequently Asked Questions

### Does Venmo integrate Payment APIs?

Venmo plugin is a quick and easy way to display to your customers your CashTag and to link them to it.
Unfortunately, this plugin doesn't integrate a full Venmo end-to-end payment. It only displays your cashtag to the customer and redirects them to it so that the off site Venmo transaction can take place.

Please check screenshots for more details on what is reported.
